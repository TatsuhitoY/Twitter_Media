This repository contains a project I worked on during my sophomore year in college when I first started learning Python. I practiced coding by collecting Twitter IDs of followers of major Japanese media and politicians using Twitter's API, and then created a co-occurrence network. There are various definitions of co-occurrence, and I experimented with several measures, including Jaccard, Dice, and Simpson coefficients. Sorry for the low readability of the code.
